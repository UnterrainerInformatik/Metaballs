# Metaballs

---

**Work in Progress**
While I'm done with the Hoffman algorithm, I'm still working on enabling the Physics2D library.

---

This demo uses the excellent [Aether.Physics2D](https://github.com/tainicom/Aether.Physics2D) library from [nkast](https://github.com/nkast) you may know from the MonoGame community.
It's available via NuGet [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aether.Physics2D).

I also use the algorithm explained in [2D Metaballs in XNA](http://nullcandy.com/2d-metaballs-in-xna/) posted by [Hoffman](http://nullcandy.com/author/hoffman/) on [NullCandy](http://nullcandy.com/) back in 2012.
